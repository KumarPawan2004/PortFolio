        <p>
        Hi, I'm Pawan Kumar Thakur, a passionate software developer with expertise in web development, C, C++, Java, MySQL, and React. I love solving complex technical problems and building innovative applications that make an impact.

Currently, I'm pursuing my B.Tech in Software Engineering at YBN University, Ranchi (2023–2027), where I actively participate in coding challenges and hackathons. I also work as a Software Engineer Intern at Eimples Lab, where I develop interactive ReactJS applications with Material-UI (MUI) and optimize user interfaces for better performance.

Apart from coding, I'm deeply interested in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) research, particularly its applications in smart wheelchairs. My research paper, “40 Years of Progress on Brain-Computer Interface Methods for Smart Wheelchair Applications”, reflects my passion for technology-driven accessibility solutions.

Beyond academics, I am an active member of the coding club at my university and was part of the organizing team for Design Hackathon 2024. My technical skills, combined with my problem-solving mindset and teamwork abilities, drive me to continuously learn and grow in the field of software development.
